Classes for managing request parameters.
 
Responsible for any client side validation, setting defaults, and serializing
to the post param string.

"_opt" is appended to member variable names when params are optional.

Using parameter objects instead of just maps/string is useful because if the api changes
you can change the object and the gwt compiler errors will identify places in the code 
that need to be updated.
